## 🚀 About the Project

**TarefApp** is a simple daily task list where users can:

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed (with visual strikethrough)
- Remove tasks (with a toast notification for feedback)
- Have their list saved in **localStorage**, keeping data between sessions

Originally started as a shopping list app, this project was refactored and rebranded as a daily task manager, gaining a new visual identity, a refreshed color palette, and a broader purpose.

## ✨ Challenges in this Stage

During this redesign phase, the following technical and design challenges were addressed:

✅ Refactored HTML/CSS structure for better semantics and scalability  
✅ New visual identity and color palette (moving away from the "shopping" theme)  
✅ Full branding redesign: new name (**TarefApp**) and slogan (*"Where dreams become tasks"*)  
✅ Custom **toast notification component** (for deletion feedback)  
✅ Improved input validation (preventing empty, symbol-only, or number-only inputs)  
✅ Better accessibility and usability (auto-focusing the input after each task is added)  
✅ Code cleanup and logic improvements for readability and maintenance

This was a great opportunity to practice not just coding, but also **UI design decisions**, **project branding**, and **user experience enhancements**.

## 🎨 Layout and Branding

This new version was redesigned by me, starting from the original layout by **Thiele Santana** ([Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1397279978314668489)).  
I customized the color palette, created a new logo, renamed the app to **TarefApp**, and added a motivational slogan (*"Where dreams become tasks"*).

The layout was adapted directly during development to create a more playful and personal visual identity, with responsive behavior for both mobile and desktop.
